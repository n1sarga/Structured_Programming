# N.J.N. Super Shop Management System
In the CSE103 (Structured Programming) course, a console-based Super Shop Management System was built in C for the final project. This application allows both admins and users to interact with a shop's product inventory. Users can view available products, purchase items, and receive a receipt. Admins can log in to manage inventory, view product lists, add new products, and delete products.

### File Management
- **Product Data Storage**: Product data is stored in a text file (`Product.txt`) and is updated when products are added or deleted by the admin.

### Acknowledgement
